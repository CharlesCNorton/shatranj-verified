# Laws of Shatranj

**Effective Date: September 7, 2025**

## PREFACE

The Laws of Shatranj cannot cover all possible situations that may arise during a game, nor can they regulate all administrative questions. Where cases are not precisely regulated by an Article of the Laws, it should be possible to reach a correct decision by studying analogous situations which are discussed in the Laws. The Laws assume that arbiters have the necessary competence, sound judgement and absolute objectivity.

These Laws respect the historical nature of Shatranj while providing clarity for modern competitive play. Where historical sources conflict, the interpretation most commonly documented in medieval manuscripts has been adopted.

## BASIC RULES OF PLAY

### Article 1: The nature and objectives of the game of Shatranj

**1.1** The game of Shatranj is played between two opponents who move their pieces alternately on a square board called a 'shatranj board'. The player with the white pieces commences the game. A player is said to 'have the move' when his opponent's move has been made.

**1.2** The objective of each player is to place the opponent's Shah 'under attack' in such a way that the opponent has no legal move. The player who achieves this goal is said to have 'checkmated' the opponent's Shah and to have won the game. Leaving one's own Shah under attack, exposing one's own Shah to attack, and 'capturing' the opponent's Shah are not allowed.

**1.3** The player may also win by achieving a 'bare king' position where all of the opponent's pieces except the Shah have been captured, unless the opponent can immediately bare the first player's Shah on the very next move.

**1.4** If the position is such that the player to move has no legal move and his Shah is not in check, the game is won by the opponent. This is called 'stalemate' and results in victory for the stalemating player.

### Article 2: The initial position of the pieces on the board

**2.1** The shatranj board is composed of an 8 x 8 grid of 64 equal squares. The board may be checkered or uncheckered according to tournament regulations.

**2.2** At the beginning of the game one player has 16 light-colored pieces (the 'white' pieces); the other has 16 dark-colored pieces (the 'black' pieces).

These pieces are as follows:
- A white Shah (King), symbol K
- A white Ferz (Counselor), symbol F
- Two white Alfils (Elephants), symbol A
- Two white Farases (Knights), symbol N
- Two white Rukhs (Rooks), symbol R
- Eight white Baidaqs (Pawns)

And correspondingly for Black.

**2.3** The initial position of the pieces on the board is as follows:
- White: Rukh a1, Faras b1, Alfil c1, Shah d1, Ferz e1, Alfil f1, Faras g1, Rukh h1, Baidaqs a2-h2
- Black: Rukh a8, Faras b8, Alfil c8, Shah d8, Ferz e8, Alfil f8, Faras g8, Rukh h8, Baidaqs a7-h7

**2.4** Alternative initial setup: The Shah may be placed on e1 (e8 for Black) with the Ferz on d1 (d8 for Black), provided both Shahs occupy the same file. This must be specified before the game begins.

### Article 3: The moves of the pieces

**3.1** It is not permitted to move a piece to a square occupied by a piece of the same color. If a piece moves to a square occupied by an opponent's piece, the latter is captured and removed from the board as part of the same move.

**3.2** The Shah may move to any square adjacent to the square it occupies. The Shah may not move into, remain in, or pass through check. There is no castling in Shatranj.

**3.3** The Ferz may move exactly one square diagonally.

**3.4** The Alfil may leap exactly two squares diagonally, passing over any intervening piece. The Alfil cannot move one square diagonally or any other distance.

**3.5** The Faras may move to one of the squares nearest to that on which it stands but not on the same rank, file or diagonal (identical to the modern chess knight).

**3.6** The Rukh may move to any square along the file or the rank on which it stands, provided no piece blocks its path.

**3.7** The Baidaq may move as follows:
a. The Baidaq may move forward to the unoccupied square immediately in front of it on the same file.
b. The Baidaq may move to a square occupied by an opponent's piece which is diagonally in front of it on an adjacent file, capturing that piece.
c. There is no initial two-square advance for Baidaqs.
d. There is no en passant capture in Shatranj.
e. When a Baidaq reaches the rank furthest from its starting position, it must be immediately exchanged for a Ferz of the same color. No other piece may be chosen. This exchange is called 'promotion' and the effect of the new Ferz is immediate.

### Article 4: The act of moving the pieces

**4.1** Each move must be made with one hand only.

**4.2** Provided that he first expresses his intention (for example by saying "adjust"), the player having the move may adjust one or more pieces on their squares.

**4.3** Except as provided in Article 4.2, if the player having the move deliberately touches on the board:
a. one or more of his own pieces, he must move the first piece touched which can be moved
b. one or more of his opponent's pieces, he must capture the first piece touched which can be captured
c. one piece of each color, he must capture the opponent's piece with his piece or, if this is illegal, move or capture the first piece touched which can be moved or captured.

**4.4** If a player having the move:
a. touches his Shah and another piece, he must move the Shah if it has a legal move
b. deliberately touches a Baidaq that has reached the promotion rank, promotion to Ferz is automatic and mandatory

**4.5** If none of the pieces touched can be moved or captured, the player may make any legal move.

**4.6** When a piece has been released on a square, it cannot be moved to another square on this move. The move is then considered to have been made.

**4.7** A player forfeits his right to claim against his opponent's violation of Article 4 once he deliberately touches a piece.

### Article 5: The completion of the game

**5.1** The game is won by the player who has checkmated his opponent's Shah. This immediately ends the game, provided that the move producing the checkmate position was legal.

**5.2** The game is won by the player who has achieved a bare king position (captured all opponent's pieces except the Shah), unless the opponent can immediately bare the first player's Shah on the very next move, in which case the game is drawn.

**5.3** The game is won by the player whose opponent is stalemated. Stalemate occurs when the player to move has no legal move and his Shah is not in check.

**5.4** The game is won by the player whose opponent declares he resigns.

**5.5** The game is drawn when:
a. Both players achieve bare king simultaneously
b. The same position has occurred three times with the same player to move
c. Both players have made 50 consecutive moves without any capture or Baidaq move
d. The position is such that neither player can possibly give checkmate or achieve bare king
e. The players agree to a draw
